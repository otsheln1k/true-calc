# true-calc

Advanced calculator for Pebble smartwatch.

It was written a long time ago, w/o Git. The code isn't really nice, but I'll fix that. You can even find a singly-linked list implementation for some reason called `array` and written with pointer arithmetics instead of `struct`.

Code in SmallMaths is from [pmath](https://github.com/editdb/Pebble-Math).

There are a few known bugs here. For instance after typing this: `( ( 1 )` won't allow you to insert a `)` to close the outer parentheses.

BTW, I *know* that Pebble is dead.
